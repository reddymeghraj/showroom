Some tips on setting up ERPNext:

1. Try and make dummy cycles: Run your dummy quotes, invoices, payments, deliveries in the system so that you can get familiar with what ERPNext can do for you.
1. Data Import Tool: You can import bulk data into system using the data import tool: via **Setup > Data > Data Import Tool**.
1. Add more users via **Setup > Users and Permissions > User**.
